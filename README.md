ProcTHOR procedurally generates interactive, diverse, and semantically plausible houses that are compatible with AI2-THOR.

## Example

Install `procthor` with PyPi:
```bash
pip install procthor
```

And then run the example script to generate a new house:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD
python scripts/example.py
```

## Citation

This code is used to generate houses for the [ProcTHOR](https://procthor.allenai.org/) paper:

## Setting up `vulkan`
To install libvulkan1 without root access, you can compile and install Vulkan in your local user space. Here's how you can do it:

1. Download Vulkan SDK:
- Visit the official Vulkan SDK page: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home
- Choose the appropriate version for your platform and download it.

2. Extract the SDK: Once downloaded, extract the SDK to a directory where you have write access, such as your home directory:
```
tar -xvf vulkansdk-linux-x.x.x.x.tar.gz -C $HOME/vulkan
```

3. Set Environment Variables: In your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`, set the necessary environment variables to point to the Vulkan SDK you've extracted:

```
export VULKAN_SDK=$HOME/vulkan/x.x.x.x/x86_64
export PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=$VULKAN_SDK/etc/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json
export VK_LAYER_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/etc/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
```
- Replace x.x.x.x with the correct version of the Vulkan SDK.
- Make sure that you set `$VULKAN_SDK` to the appropriate location of where you untarred the SDK
- Note that you might not have the file located at `$VK_ICD_FILENAMES`. Here, you have to search for the ICD file in the system.
On the CUBIC cluster, this file was found in: `/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.x86_64.json`. In this case, `VK_ICD_FILENAMES`
was set to that file. That is, `export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.x86_64.json` was used.

4. Test Installation: After setting up the environment, check if Vulkan is installed correctly by running:
```vulkaninfo```

5. Check that `vulkan` detects the GPU:
```vulkaninfo | grep "GPU"```
You should see something like:
```
'DISPLAY' environment variable not set... skipping surface info
GPU0:
	deviceType        = PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_DISCRETE_GPU
```

This should allow you to run Vulkan applications without requiring root access.
